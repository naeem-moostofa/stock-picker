Evaluates stocks and creates a diversified portfolio with the goal of outperforming the market. 

## Project Description

For my final project in CFM101 I worked in a group of three to design a program that takes a list of stock tickers and produces a diversified stock portfolio with the goal of beating the market. 

In order to evaluate a stock we analyzed the Sharpe Ratio and Beta of stocks over the past three years to predict future performance.  

We placed second in our week long class competition, generating returns of 1.3% during the week.
